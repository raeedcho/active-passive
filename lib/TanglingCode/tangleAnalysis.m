%% TANGLEANALYSIS.m
% This analysis determines how 'tangled' a given dataset is. That is, how
% often the projections in high-D space cross over each other in different
% directions. The tangle index (q) of a pair of time points is given by the
% squared  difference in their derivative divided by the squared difference
% in their state. A constant (proportional to the variance of the data) is
% added to the denominator to prevent hyperbolic growth.
%
%
% Note that although tangling can be calculated for every pair of times,
% the value that is most informative is the maximum a given time point
% becomes tangled with any other time point. This value is the output 'Q'.
%
% SYNTAX
%   [ Q, out] = tangleAnalysis( Data, .001 ); % for data collected at 1kHz
%
% INPUTS:
%
% Required Inputs:
% * Data (struct) - a C-dimensional structure where C is the number of
% conditions. For a given condition, Data(c).A should hold the data (e.g.
% firing rates). Each column of A corresponds to a neuron, and each row to
% a timepoint. Data(c).times and Data(c).analyzeTimes are a optional
% fields. size(Data(c).times,1) should equal size(Data(c).A,1). If
% Data(c).analyzeTimes is provided, only those entries that match between
% 'times' and 'analyzeTimes' will be used for the analysis. If analyzeTimes
% == [], all times will be used.
%
% * samplingRate (scalar) - a scalar indicating how much time in seconds
% passes with each sample in the data.
%
% Optional Inputs:
% Several parameters can be specified from the command line (see Usage
% Examples below)
% * numPCs (scalar, default: 8) - specifies how many PCs to use when
% calculating tangling
% * fracVar (scalar, default: .85) - if numPCs is empty, the number of PCs
% will be chosed based on the number needed to caputure as much variance as
% specified by fracVar.
% * cond2use (vector, default: 1:length(Data)) - specifies which conditions
% to use in calculating tangling
% * withinConditionsOnly (logical, default: false) - if desired, tangling
% will only be calculated for pairs of times that correspond to the same
% condition
% * timeStep (scalar, default: 20) - Because tangling is a pairwise
% computation, things can get quite slow if enough data is included. After
% calculating the derivitive, it can be efficient to calculate tangling
% only on every ith time sample where i is specified by timeStep. It is
% generally advisible to keep this number as low as possible without
% computation times getting unreasonably long (e.g. > ~30 seconds). Note
% that if this number is too high, aliasing could occur and tangling could
% appear lower than it actually is.
% * softenNorm (scalar, default: 5) - In the usual Churchlandian fashion,
% soft normalization is performed on the neural data such that each neuron
% is devided by its range (across all times and conditions) + some constant
% indicated by softenNorm. EMG data should be fully normalized (i.e.
% softenNorm set to 0).
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% * Q (vector) - the tangling index for each time point
% * out (struct) - 
%
% USAGE EXAMPLES
%   [ Q, out] = tangleAnalysis( Data, .02, 'numPCs', 10 ); % to calculate tangling with 10 PCs; data collected every 20 ms
%   [ Q, out] = tangleAnalysis( Data, .001, 'cond2use', [1 4:6 10] ,'withinConditionsOnly',true); % to calculate tangling only on conditions #1,4,5,6,10 and only within conditions
