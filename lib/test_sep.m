function [separability,mdl] = test_sep(td,params)
% TEST_SEP uses LDA to classify active and passive trials from signals
% Inputs:
%   td - trial_data structure
%   params - params struct
%       use_trials - use these trials to calculate model
%       signals - signals to use for LDA
%       do_plot - whether to plot separability plot
%       mdl - if not empty, will use this model instead of fitting
%           a new one
% Outputs:
%   separability - classification accuracy of LDA on signals
%   mdl - output model from LDA fitting
%
% Note: does not cross-validate by itself. If you want crossval, fit
% a model with training data, then pass in test data along with the
% model into params.mdl
